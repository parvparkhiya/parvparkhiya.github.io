      <description>&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is an essential part of any mobile robot. While the current stateof-the-art approach solves the problem in a static environment reasonably well, the performance in a dynamic environment is hit or miss. The traditional SLAM method assumes that the number of measurements from static objects would be large enough to dominate measurements from dynamic objects. We advocate for the explicit filtering of measurements from dynamic objects for better localization and mapping performance. We use the landscape theory of aggregation method to form an optimization problem. We observe the measurements for a timewindow and compute weights for the optimization. We perform gradient descent to minimize the energy to classify and filter out measurements from dynamic objects. Finally, using ROS’s GMapping Package we show improved SLAM output.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Constructing Category-Specific Models for Monocular Object-SLAM</title>
      <link>https://parvparkhiya.github.io/project/oslam/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We present a new paradigm for real-time object-oriented SLAM with a monocular camera. Contrary to previous approaches, that rely on object-level models, we construct category-level models from CAD collections which are now widely available. To alleviate the need for huge amounts of labeled data, we develop a rendering pipeline that enables synthesis of large datasets from a limited amount of manually labeled data. Using data thus synthesized, we learn category-models for object deformations in 3D, as well as discriminative object features in 2D. These category models are instance-independent and aid in the design of object landmark observations that can be incorporated into a generic monocular SLAM framework. Where typical object-SLAM approaches usually solve only for object and camera poses, we also estimate object shape on-the-fly, allowing for a wide range of objects from the category to be present in the scene. Moreover, since our 2D object features are learned discriminatively, the proposed object-SLAM system succeeds in several scenarios where sparse feature-based monocular SLAM fails due to insufficient features or parallax. Also, the proposed category-models help in object instance retrieval, useful for Augmented Reality (AR) applications. We evaluate the proposed framework on multiple challenging real-world scenes and show — to the best of our knowledge — first results of an instance-independent monocular object-SLAM system and the benefits it enjoys over feature-based SLAM methods.&lt;/p&gt;
