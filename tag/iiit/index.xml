      <title>Constructing Category-Specific Models for Monocular Object-SLAM</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We present a new paradigm for real-time object-oriented SLAM with a monocular camera. Contrary to previous approaches, that rely on object-level models, we construct category-level models from CAD collections which are now widely available. To alleviate the need for huge amounts of labeled data, we develop a rendering pipeline that enables synthesis of large datasets from a limited amount of manually labeled data. Using data thus synthesized, we learn category-models for object deformations in 3D, as well as discriminative object features in 2D. These category models are instance-independent and aid in the design of object landmark observations that can be incorporated into a generic monocular SLAM framework. Where typical object-SLAM approaches usually solve only for object and camera poses, we also estimate object shape on-the-fly, allowing for a wide range of objects from the category to be present in the scene. Moreover, since our 2D object features are learned discriminatively, the proposed object-SLAM system succeeds in several scenarios where sparse feature-based monocular SLAM fails due to insufficient features or parallax. Also, the proposed category-models help in object instance retrieval, useful for Augmented Reality (AR) applications. We evaluate the proposed framework on multiple challenging real-world scenes and show — to the best of our knowledge — first results of an instance-independent monocular object-SLAM system and the benefits it enjoys over feature-based SLAM methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Camera Model Identification</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We apply the algorithm proposed by Chen etal to identify camera models. The algorithm assumes that CFA pattern used by the device is GBRG. Local co-occurrence features are computed using multiple interpolation algorithms (example nearest neighbour, bilinear). A multi-class linear SVM is trained with these features and employed to classify the given image to one of the camera classes. Some observations have been made with respect to validation accuracy of the model and the results obtained on Kaggle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Augmented Reality 3D Room Decore Preview</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have developed a Matlab application to add 3D model of chair, lamp, cycle, vase etc in a captured real world image so that it could simulate how would room look like if the object was really present in that environment. For that, we place a simple marker where we have to put the 3D model and acquire the information of placement and orientation of the marker in 3d space, we place our 3D model with same orientation as that of marker. Followed by blending it with captured image.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Doubly Convolutional Neural Networks [Implementation]</title>
      <link>https://parvparkhiya.github.io/project/dcnn/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Parameter sharing is the major reason of success of building large models for deep neural networks. The paper proposed by Shuangfei Zhai, Yu Cheng, Weining Lu and Zhongfei Zhang (NIPS 2016) introduces the idea of Doubly Convolutional Neural Networks, which significantly improves the performance of CNN with the same number of parameters. We have implemented DCNN as a part of Statistical  Methods in AI Project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a small narrative driven puzzle based top down 2D role-playing video game made in unity. It consists of original story with multiple choices at various stages leading to multiple endings. Along with giving historical perspective of medieval India, it challenges player with tough moral choices and situation based puzzles. Polished version of game is playable in windows using gyroscope sensor of android phone. Crude ported version can be played online using keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
